Inspired by the multiple vertical layers of maps like _By Committee_ and _The Hard Stuff Rules_, I wanted an interactive map where I could hide polygons by elevation. I fortunately found a lot of help in the work previously completed by [Hopper](https://github.com/Hopper262/).

TODO:
- zoom and pan (? https://github.com/bumbu/svg-pan-zoom)
- on-map (or adjacent) legend and scale
- play sounds on hover (including monsters, platforms, water, etc.)
- per-level overlays.json to support changing monster alliances
- link terminals to Story pages
- some method to better highlight the locations of overlay items (single items can get lost on busy maps)
- display category counts
- dynamic water level
    - fluctuating between the min/max at the appropriate rate
    - changing by toggling map switches and triggers
- implement top-down map navigation, item inventory, attacks, and damage
